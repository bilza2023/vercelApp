## Core Data Structure of the Presentation Module

- **Date**: 6th November 2023

### Purpose
This document defines the core data structure of the Presentation module. It serves as a guide for component authors responsible for creating the draw and Edit/Save components. All authors should accept and encode their data following this structure.

### Stability
- This data structure remains unchanged for this version of the engine.
- It has long-term support and is expected to accommodate over 100 components.

### Structure
1. **pulse**: The running time.
2. **startTime**: The slide's start time (used for internal purposes like showing a growing bar, etc.).
3. **endTime**: Same as above.
4. **items**: An array of item objects with the following fields:
   - `name`: Name
   - `content`: Content
   - `showAt`: Show at time (default: 0)
   - `itemExtra`: Additional item data
   - *Note*: Additional fields may be added to the items object in the future, but it won't require changes to existing components.Every component author can add his own fields to this object while save time and use them at draw time.
   - The "items" field is designed for situations where there is one loop in every slide, which forms the core of drawing. Authors can use it as needed.
   - The "itemExtra" field is an array of key-value pair objects to send additional data.
   - Content within "item.content" can be stringified and parsed within components.
   - The "name" field in the item object allows authors to select items either by name or by index numbers.

5. **slideExtra**: An array of key-value pair objects for slide-specific data that doesn't belong to all or some items but relates to the slide.

6. **theme**: The theme object, which may change in the future, but any changes will require updates to all components (draw).

### Mongoose Schema
```javascript
const KVPairSchema = new Schema({
    key: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    value: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        default: '',
    },
});

const ItemSchema = new Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: false,
    },
    content: {
        type: String,
        required: false,
    },
    showAt: {
        type: Number,
        required: true,
        default: 0,
    },
    extra: {
        type: [KVPairSchema],
        required: true,
        default: [],
    },
});

const SlidesSchema = new Schema({
    startTime: {
        type: Number,
        required: false,
    },
    endTime: {
        type: Number,
        required: false,
    },
    type: {
        type: String,
        required: false,
    },
    version: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        default: '0.0.0',
    },
    template: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        default: '',
    },
    items: {
        type: [ItemSchema],
        required: true,
        default: [],
    },
    slideExtra: {
        type: [KVPairSchema],
        required: true,
        default: [],
    },
});


# Chat GPT Response

Your data structure for Slide objects looks well-defined. Here are some precise comments:

1. The structure appears to be appropriately organized, providing clarity for authors responsible for the draw and edit/save components.

2. The "items" field is designed to hold data for individual elements to be drawn, which is a practical approach. Authors can use this array as needed.

3. The inclusion of "itemExtra" allows flexibility in sending additional data as key-value pairs, offering versatility in your components.

4. Stringifying content within this data and parsing it within components is a good practice to manage complex data structures.

5. The "name" field in the item object allows for flexibility in selecting items either by name or index numbers, catering to different author preferences.

6. The "slideExtra" array is a useful addition for storing data that doesn't fit into the "items" array but is related to the slide.

7. The Mongoose Schema provided aligns well with your data structure, ensuring compatibility for database storage.

Overall, your data structure seems robust and suitable for creating a presentation/slide show app. It offers a good balance of structure and flexibility for component authors.
