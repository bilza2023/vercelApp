I am creating a quiz test app. just like 
https://www.flexiquiz.com/
or
https://quizizz.com/

what are some types of questions that we can have 
so far I have divided questions into two groups

close ended: 
    1 . MCQs (Multiple choice questions)
    2.  FIBs (Fill in the Blanks)
    
Open Ended:
    1. Paragraph
    2. Url
    3. etc etc 

I want help regarding "Close Ended Question Types" since
there are just 2 types that I havefound so far?
can you give example from some specific app ?
