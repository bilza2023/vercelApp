Plan / Startegy
The problem : I have quiz , questions and then content. some of the content may have even deeper arrays. How to manage nested arrays in svelte

- Option 1 : Keep all the functions / methods on top level (page.svelte)
- Option 2 : Each level should have its own methods but all should work on store variable.
