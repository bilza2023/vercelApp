answer

Preventing audio files from being easily downloadable while still making them playable in the browser is a common concern. You can take some measures to achieve this goal:

1. **Streaming Services**: Consider hosting your audio files on a streaming service or a content delivery network (CDN) that offers security features. These services often provide measures to prevent direct downloads.

2. **Audio Watermarking**: Apply audio watermarking techniques that can discourage users from downloading the audio, as it may still be identifiable even if they record it during playback.

3. **Obfuscation**: You can obfuscate the URLs or file paths to your audio files. This won't make them completely secure but can make it slightly more challenging for users to discover the direct file links.

4. **Server-Side Playback**: Control the playback of the audio on the server side. Users would need to interact with your app to access the audio content. This doesn't prevent recording, but it makes direct downloading less straightforward.

5. **DRM (Digital Rights Management)**: For a more advanced and secure approach, consider implementing DRM solutions. These provide a high level of content protection, although they can be complex and costly to set up.

It's essential to keep in mind that there's no foolproof way to make content completely inaccessible to determined users, as any content delivered to a user's device can potentially be recorded or intercepted. Your goal should be to make it more difficult and discourage unauthorized downloading.

Depending on the level of security you require and your resources, you can choose the approach that best fits your needs and technical capabilities.
